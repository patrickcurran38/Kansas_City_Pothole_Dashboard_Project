# Kansas City Pothole Dashboard Project

Kansas City 311 call center data was used to find all reported potholes between January 1 and February 25, 2020.  A metric tree was then created in Microsoft Excel to develop key performance indicators (KPIs).  These KPIs can then be used by the city government to glean information about and to improve the response times to pothole requests from 311.

A dashboard was then ceated in Tableau using metrics developed in the metric tree to keep track of progress on the key performance indicators.  This dashboard was then used to create a recorded PowerPoint presentation, which is available for download in this folder.
